\page org_mitk_views_odfmaximaextraction ODF Peak Extraction

This view provides the user interface to extract the principal diffusion direction of tensors and the peaks of spherical harmonic ODFs using gradient descent optimization.

The output peaks can for example be used for streamline tractography.
