\page org_mitk_views_fiberquantification Fiber Quantification

This view provides tools to derive additional information (such as tract density images and principal fiber direction maps) from tractograms.

\section SecFiberQuantInput Input Data

- Tractogram: The input streamlines.
- Reference Image: The output images will have the same geometry as this reference image (optional). If a reference image with DICOM tags is used, the resulting tract envelope can be saved as DICOM Segmentation Object.

\section SecFDI Fiber-derived Images

- Tract density image: The voxel values correspond to the sum of all fiber segment lengths in the respective voxel.
- Normalized TDI: 0-1 normalized version of the TDI.
- Binary envelope: Generate a binary segmentation from the input tractogram.
- Fiber bundle image: Generate a 2D rgba image representation of the fiber bundle.
- Fiber endings image: Generate a 2D image showing the locations of fiber endpoints.
- Fiber endings pointset: Generate a poinset containing the locations of fiber endpoints (not recommended for large tractograms).

\section SecPD Principal Fiber Directions

Calculate the voxel-wise principal fiber directions (fixels) from a tractogram.
- Max. Peaks: Maximum number of output directions per voxel.
- Angular Threshold: Cluster directions that are close together using the specified threshold (in degree).
- Size Threshold: Discard principal directions with a magnitude smaller than the specified threshold. This value is the vector magnitude raltive to the largest vector in the voxel.
- Normalization: Normalize the principal fiber directions by the global maximum, the voxel-wise maximum or each direction individually.
- Output \#Directions per Voxel: Generate an image that contains the number of principal directions per voxel as values.
