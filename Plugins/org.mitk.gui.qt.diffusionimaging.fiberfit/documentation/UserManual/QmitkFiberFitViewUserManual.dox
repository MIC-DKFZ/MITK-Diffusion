Linearly fits a scalar weight for each streamline in order to optimally explain the input image. Corrseponding command line tool is MitkFitFibersToImage.

\section SecFiberFitParams Input Data and Parameters

- Image: The image data used to fit the fiber weights. Possible input types:
  - Peak images. The input peak magnitudes are approximated using the voxel-wise fixel magnitudes obtained from the input tractogram.
  - Raw diffusion-weighted images. The dMRI signal is approximated using a tensor model with fixed diffusion parameters. Tensor orientations are determined by the input tractogram.
  - Sclar valued images (e.g. FA, axon density maps, ...).
- Tractogram: The method fits a weight for each streamline in the input tractogram. In the command line tool, a list of separate bundles can be used as input.
- Regularization:
  - Voxel-wise Variance: Constrain the fiber weights to be similar in one voxe (similar to [1]). Command line tool string "VoxelVariance".
  - Variance: Constrain the fiber weights to be globally similar (mean squared deaviation of weights from mean weight). Command line tool string "Variance".
  - Mean-squared magnitude: Enforce small weights using the mean-squared magnitude of the streamlines as regularization factor. Command line tool string "MSM".
  - Lasso: L1 regularization of the streamline weights. Enforces a sparse weight vector. Command line tool string "Lasso".
  - Group Lasso: Useful if individual bundles are used as input (command-line tool only). This regularization tries to explain the signal with as few bundles as possible penalizing the bundle-wise root mean squared magnitude of the weighs (see [2]). Command line tool string "GroupLasso".
  - Group Variance: Constrain the fiber weights to be similar for each bundle individually (command-line tool only). Command line tool string "GrouplVariance".
  - No regularization. Command line tool string "NONE".
- Suppress Outliers: Perform second optimization run with an upper weight bound based on the first weight estimation (99% quantile).
- Output Residuals: Add residual images to the data manager.
